## Description

This is my personal solution for the Frontend Mentor REST Countries API challenge. It was built using 
the Next.js static generation feature along with Typescript and modern React tools such as Hooks and 
functional components. Thanks to Github Actions the site is automatically rebuilt monthly to keep 
countries' data up to date. Finally, for styling, I used CSS with SASS as a preprocessor. 
A previous version of this application that a built using only React can be found [here](https://github.com/PerezEnrique/countries-info-app)
